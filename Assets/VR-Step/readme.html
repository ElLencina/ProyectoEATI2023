<h2>1 - Version History</h2>
<p> V 1.0 - VR Step released</p>
<p> V 1.1 - Jumping support added, updated to use the GoogleVR SDK instead of the deprecated Cardboard SDK</p>
<p> V 1.2 - Added UnityNativeVRController as an alternative to GoogleVR.  This allows for easier setup for non-GoogleVR setups. </p>
<p> V 1.3 - Removed GoogleVR-specific prefab, as it isn't necessary for things to work there any more.  Now there's just 1 prefab and it should work across all headsets.  Also added Oculus Go support. </p>
	
	
<h2>2 - About VR Step</h2>
	<p> VR Step is a virtual reality plugin for Unity that allows your users to walk in place to move with no extra instrumentation.  It is designed to be used with Google VR, and works on any VR-ready Android or IPhone device.  You can now design full, open worlds that your users can explore freely in VR, and you won't limit your userbase by requiring things like bluetooth controllers.</p>
	
	<p> See Gravity Pull VR on the IOS and Android app stores for an example of this plugin in action.  Currently, this plugin is designed for mobile VR, and it should work out-of-the-box with GoogleVR (Cardboard and Daydream) and GearVR.</p>

<h2>3 - Quick Start</h2>
	<h3>Importing the Asset</h3>
		<p>If you are targeting Daydream or Cardboard, you must first import the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/download">Google VR SDK</a> before importing the VR Step asset. VR Step should work correctly with any version of the Google VR SDK, but the included prefabs do require at least the Cardboard SDK v0.6.0 release.  If you are using an older version of the SDK, the demo scene or the WIPPlayer prefab may not work, so skip to the "Adding the scripts manually" section.</p>
		<p>If you are targeting GearVR, or you don't want to import the GoogleVR SDK, you do not need to.  </p>
		<p>You may import whatever components you like, but you should import the entire "Scripts" folder at minimum.  </p>
		
	<h3>Using the demo scene</h3>
		<p>Included in the folder "DemoScene" are 2 demo scenes that demonstrate the walking in place.  Simply load the appropriate scene (GoogleVRJumpGame if you are using GoogleVR SDK, if not open the other one)  and click "Play" to try it out in the editor.  To simulate a detected step, hit the Up Arrow on your keyboard.  If you are using the GoogleVR SDK, you can look around by holding the "Alt" key and move your mouse (this is from Google VR, the camera and mouse movement are not part of VR Step).  To simulate jumping, hit the space button on your keyboard.</p>
		
		<p>You can look at the WIPPlayer object in the scene to see how it is composed.</p>
		
	<h3>Using the WIPPlayer prefabs</h3>
		<p>The VR-Step prefabs are an easy way to instantly have a controllable, walking-in-place controlled VR camera in your scene.  Simply drag the prefab into a scene and move the top-level WIPPlayer object to position the player.</p>

		<p>We've included 2 different prefabs for you.  The GoogleVRController prefab requires that you have the GoogleVR SDK installed.  The UnityNativeVRController will work with any VR platform.  Both are controlled with a RigidBody component. </p>
		
		<p>Do not include multiple of these prefabs in the same scene</p>
		
		<h4>GoogleVRController</h4>
		
			<p>The top-level object of the GoogleVRController object has the Google VR Viewer script attached to it.  For information on Google VR scripts, see the Google VR documentation.</p>
			
			<p>You'll note that the prefab has 2 children, a "PlayerCollider" object, which is the main driver of movement, and a "StepDetector" object, which is the object that runs the step detection.</p>
			
			<p>The GvrHead object is parented to the PlayerCollider object.  It's important to note that the "Track Position" boolean is UNCHECKED, and the "Target" attribute is set to the top-level parent object (WIPPlayer).  This is an important setting, without it you will see strange behaviour</p>
			
			<p>The bulk of the settings are on the PlayerRigidBodoy object.  See the sections below on each component for more information</p>
		
		<h4>UnityNativeVRController</h4>
		
			<p>The top-level object is just a simple empty object called UnityNativeVRController.  This just serves as a way to organize the components and move everything all at once.</p>
			
			<p>You'll note that the prefab has 3 children, a "PlayerCollider" object, which is the main driver of movement, a "StepDetector" object, which is the object that runs the step detection, and a "CameraMovement" object.</p>
			
			<p>The actual Unity camera is parented to the "CameraMovement" object.  The "CameraMovement" object has a "ChildOnlyPosition" script on it, which will makes sure that the camera moves along with the PlayerCollider object.  We can't put the "ChildOnlyPosition" object directly onto the Camera, because with Native Unity VR, you cannot move the camera object directly.  See the Unity documentation for more info.</p>
			
			<p>The bulk of the settings are on the PlayerCollider object.  See the sections below on each component for more information</p>
			
		<h4> Adding the scripts manually </h4>
			
			<p>We recommend using the prefabs as a base and building off of them.  If you need to add the scripts to an existing setup manually, you'll need to do a few things.</p>
			
			<p>You need to have the StepDetector script on any object in the scene.  You cannot have more than one of this script present in your scene.  It doesn't matter which object it is assigned to, but we recommend assigning it to its own object to easily find it. </p>
			
			<p>The WIPController script needs to be assigned to an object that also has a RigidBody controller.  Make sure to set the "Forwards Transform" property to your Camera object.  This property will determine which direction you move. </p>
			
			<p>The WIPController script will rotate itself to align with the Forwards Transform object.  If you have the camera parented to your RigidBody object, this will often result in an "infinite rotation" happening, unless your camera script can automatically correct for this (like the GoogleVR camera does).  </p>
			
			<p>Instead of parenting the camera directly, we recommend having it parented to an empty "movement" object.  On that movement object, you can use the included ChildOnlyPosition script and set the target to be the object that has the RigidBody assigned to it.  That script will make the movement object act as if it were parented to RigidBody object, but won't inherit any rotation from the RigidBody object.  See the UnityNativeVRController prefab on how this should be set up.</p>

<h2>4 - Main Components</h2>
	<h3>Step Detector</h3>
		<p>The Step Detector script uses the accelerometer and gyroscope input from the phone to detect when the player has taken a step.  These values are read through Unity's Input class.  If you need to read the accelerometer and gyroscope from another source, you will have to modify the script.  </p>
		
		<p>The StepDetector acts as a Singleton object within a scene, so you should only ever have 1 of them in a scene.</p>
		
		<p>We recommend not changing the default values on the StepDetector component, but they are available for customization if you need them.  Below are the values exposed by the inspector.</p>
		
		<p><b>Filter Num Samples to Average</b> - This value affects signal smoothing.  Higher values will smooth the accelerometer signal more and filter out noise, but increase latency.  Lower values will have more noise, but lower latency.  The recommended number is 4.</p>
		
		<p><b>Step Min Threshold</b> - This value acts as a sort of "sensitivity" setting.  It represents the slope of step detection values required to detect a step.  A higher value will REDUCE the number of steps required, and if it is too high your players will have to stomp or jump hard to get a step detected.  A lower value will INCREASE the number of steps required, and if it is too low will result in almost any head movement registering as a step.  We recommend values between .2 and .5.  The default value of .35 has shown good results for us in testing.</p>
		
		<p><b>Simulate Steps with Key</b> - If you do not want to use the up arrow in the editor to simulate steps, you can change it to another key.</p>
		
		<h4>Registering functions to react to detected steps</h4>
		
		<p>If you would like to write your own scripts that respond to steps, you can register them with the StepDetector by using the static methods "AddStepAction" and "RemoveStepAction".  An exteremely basic example is included in the script "PlaySoundOnStep". </p>
		
		<p>Generally, you would want to register a function to be called in that object's "Start" function.  The function must take no arguments and must return nothing.  Here is an example:</p>
		
		<p>public class PlaySoundOnStep : MonoBehaviour { <br>
		<blockquote>
		public AudioSource sound;  <br>
		 <br>
		void Start() {
			<blockquote>VRStep.StepDetector.AddStepAction(OnStep);  </blockquote>
		} 
		 <br>
		void OnStep() { 
			<blockquote>sound.Play();</blockquote>
		} <br>
		 <br>
	</blockquote>}</p>
		
	<h3>WIPController</h3>
		<p>The WIPController is what drives movement.  Generally you would have a RigidBody component also attached to the object, but if you do not you can write a custom script to pull the velocity generated by the script and use it to drive your own controller.</p>
		
		<p>The WIPController uses the time between steps to define how quickly the player moves.  If they are running, the time between steps is small, so they will move quickly.  If they are walking slowly, the time between steps is larger, so they will move more slowly.  If the time between steps gets large enough, they will stop.  These values are shown below. </p>
		
		<p><b>Max Forward Velocity</b>- This is the maximum velocity that the character will move</p>
		
		<p><b>Min Forward Velocity</b>- This is the minimum velocity that the character will move</p>
		
		<p><b>Damping value</b>- Every FixedUpdate frame, the velocity is multiplied by this value to slow them down.  We recommend a value of .95 or higher.  1 will do no damping, and your character will only slow down if no steps have been detected in a time defined by the Stopping Step Time value.</p>
		
		<p><b>Min Step Time</b>- If the time between steps is this or lower, velocity is set to max forward velocity </p>
		
		<p><b>Max Step Time</b>- If the time between steps is this or higher, velocity is set to the min forward velocity</p>
		
		<p><b>Stopping Step Time</b>- If the time between steps is this or higher, velocity is set to 0.</p>
		
		<p><b>Rotate Towards Gaze</b> - If checked, the object this script is attached to will be rotated to align with the gaze of the cardboardhead object (not including looking up and down).  If not checked, there is no rotation, and you will have to set the rotation manually.  The movement is always in the forward vector (the Z vector of the transform, or transform.forward). </p>
		
		<p><b>Forward Transform</b> - The reference to the Transform that is pointing forward, usually you want this to be the GVR head object.  The up/down tilt orientation of this object is ignored. </p>
		
		<p><b>Jump Enabled</b> - Whether or not jumping should be allowed. </p>
		
		<p><b>Jump Detection Threshold</b> - How much upwards acceleration should trigger the jump.</p>
		
		<p><b>On Ground</b> - Whether or not the object is currently on the ground.  This is set by the CheckIfOnGround function automatically</p>
		
		<p><b>Ground Layer Mask</b> - The layers that count as ground, assign this layer to the objects that represent the ground</p>
		
		<p><b>Jump Grace Period</b> - The amount of time after leaving the ground that the user can still jump, to avoid frustration for your users.  A setting of about .3 works well, but you can experiment. </p>
		
<h2>5 - Tips and recommendations</h2>
	<p>While WIP lets your users explore large environments freely, it can still be somewhat tiring to walk in place too much.  You may want to design your game around minimal amounts of walking, unless you are making an exercise game.  For example, in our game Gravity Pull, you manipulate boxes in a portal-like environment to solve puzzles.  Initially you had to walk up to a box to pick it up, but if you missed your target when throwing it, people had to walk way too much.  Instead, we made it so that players can pull objects towards them from any distance.  </p>
	
	<p>Be careful about what velocity values you use.  While WIP does seem to reduce the risk of simulator sickness, high velocities can still make some people feel sick.  </p>
	
	<p>Follow Google VR's guidelines to designing VR games and VR UIs.</p>
